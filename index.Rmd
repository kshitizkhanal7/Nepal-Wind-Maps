Nepal Wind Maps
===============

This is an exploration to try and map wind data in Nepal. The first step is to make an overall map.

```{r}
# You will need to change the directory in the following line based on where
# you have cloned https://github.com/prabhasp/Nepal-Wind-Maps
# setwd("~/Code/Nepal-Wind-Maps/")
require(raster)
wind <- raster('data/Wind_5ewam.tif')

require(rasterVis)
gplot(wind) + geom_tile(aes(fill=value)) + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low='yellow', high='red', trans='sqrt')
```
